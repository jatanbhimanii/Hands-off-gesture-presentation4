# HandGesture-Mini-Project-
This project on AI Hand Gesture for slide changing is a fascinating application of Artificial Intelligence that enables users to change slides during presentations without having to touch their computer or mobile device. This project recognizes hand gestures, specifically those related to slide changing. "All fingers opened" moves to next slide. "All fingers closed" moves to previous slide' "First finger opened" helps us to draw. "First two fingers opened"  shows a pointer. "First three fingers" erases everything we have drawn. Pressing "q" exits from the slides.
